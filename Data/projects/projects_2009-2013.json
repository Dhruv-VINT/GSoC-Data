    "details": "Gephi is able to export its network as SVG or PDF format. Using vectorial drawings for graph have many benefits like infinite zooming or clear shapes. The aim of this proposal is to develop a preview module in Gephi for seeing how the output will exactly looks like with the given parameters.\r\n\r\nWhereas the embedded 3D engine is designed for efficient network exploration the vectorial export concentrate on clarity, readability and outstanding design. This module has many different settings like edge thickness, arrow size, white borders around labels, node border and so on. In the vein of WYSIWYG editors we would like to see direct setting change on a Vectorial Preview window. The module must be scalable to support large networks.\r\n\r\nTo resume there are two requirements, previewing the network exactly how it will looks-like in output and support huge graphs efficiently.\r\n\r\nAn approach proposed by the mentors consists in using the output generated by the Gephi Rich SVG Export module to reconstruct and display the network. By importing the demo input \"celegans.gexf\", the generated SVG file has size 1.8MB. Building the preview from an SVG file generated each time an option is (un)checked seems to be a too loud process appearing not to be scalable for large networks, especially on old computers. Moreover, there does not seem to be a \"transitory\" state of data: data is directly exported to SVG in the ExporterSVG class.\r\n\r\nFinally, my approach is to generalize the vectorial transformation process into a class called ExporterVectorial, for instance, in which the final shape of rendering is abstracted: it will create a new transitory data set designed for a vectorial output. By (un)checking any option, ExporterVectorial will be called, generating the vectorial data that a new class VectorialPreview will render on the SVG export panel using Java 2D. When the \"Finish\" button will be pressed, ExporterVectorial will be called again and then ExporterSVG will use the output data to render it into the SVG format. In fact, SVG and preview outputs will come from a same data input designed especially for vectorial rendering. In addition, an idea could be to implement a \"Preview\" checkbox on each vectorial export panel, which would allow people using old computers to choose if they want an automatic preview or not.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the main interrogations are:\r\n    * will the graph be displayed entirely or partially?\r\n    * if displayed partially, how to browse it and make the preview readable?\r\n\r\nAbout the development method, a new Bazaar branch will be created from a \"rather stable\" Gephi development version, and the work will be done on it. Once the GSOC ended, it is hoped that it will be merged into the trunk branch.\r\n\r\nHere is the planning schedule:\r\n    * April 20th - May 23rd: understanding of existing Gephi code, following of current development evolution;\r\n    * May 23rd - June 26th: class diagram design, Java 2D API discovering, rendering few nodes in the preview window then thousands/millions to test performance;\r\n    * June 27th - August 17th: proper development of the proposed approach.",

Aggregated, they represent most of the features needed and wanted for building a social site. Unfortunately, finding, evaluating, and integrating these modules together is very time-intensive due to the varying quality of contrib modules.\r\nCreating a social framework in Drupal will pull together these modules into a cohesive package.\r\n\r\nGoals:\r\n* Non-technical (ie. no coding knowledge) administrators should be able to roll out a social site using this framework\r\n* Where appropriate, allow admins to choose which module to implement a particular feature (ie. the various profile modules) like wysiwyg with text editors\r\n* Create custom code to bridge contrib modules together and close feature gaps unfilled by existing contrib modules\r\n* Document how the contrib modules fit together to form the framework and how custom code bridges these modules together\r\n* Create an install profile to configure the framework initially\r\n* Create an administrative section to coordinate the configuration of the different framework modules (time permitting)\r\n* Include UI and usability improvements like Popups API or Ajax submit to improve the user experience (time-permitting)",

In-addition, if publications (Journal e.g. JASIST (Wiley), IPM (Elsevier) or Conference e.g. JCDL, ECDL) can be segregated based on ranking it would add much value from management perspective. A summarized report in this form from various academic disciplines in Institutes of higher learning would definitely drive strong interest from the stakeholders of Institutional Repositories. Our plan is to achieve this report generation based on data extracted from the Dspace IR and present this grouped by various custom filter options such as author, contribution period, publication ranking, and summarized report for each academic discipline etc. The motivation to this proposal is based on feedback received from the academic community during a presentation that was meant for encouraging contribution into repositories. Based on our initial thoughts we plan to use \"DataVision\", an open source report writer tool for report generation and subsequent integration of the same as an add-on to DSpace.

    "details": "The goal is to provide an easy way, well integrated into the desktop, to setup DVB devices, record and watch TV shows. The foundation was established during last year's GSoC where I implemented basic features like recording shows and scanning for channels. However, there is still a lot of work to be done so that a non-technical user can make use of my work without problems, too.\r\n\r\nThe first step is to fix outstanding major bugs. Scanning for channels does currently not yield the same results on every scan. The bug might be somewhere in GStreamer's mpegtsparse element. In addition, it's currently not possible to record or watch two or more channels that are part of the same transport stream simultaneously. Only the stream of the channel that is selected first works properly, all other streams are disrupted.\r\n\r\nAlthough, there's basic support for watching live TV (based on gst-rtsp-server) it is a relatively new feature that hasn't seen much testing, yet. First of all, the work should be based on the latest version of gst-rtsp-server. Currently, the biggest downside is that live TV and recordings are two separate parts of the program. Because of that conflicts between live TV and recordings are not resolved. If you are watching live TV and a recording is about to start on a different channel the daemon should automatically switch to the channel of the recording.\r\n\r\nAnother major goal is to better integrate GNOME DVB Daemon into Totem. Only experienced users can make use of Totem's DVB features, because you have to generate the channel list with a command line tool and place the generated file in a special place. Additionally, it's only possible to use multiple DVB adapters if they are all of the same type. DVB Daemon already addresses all of the above issues, but it is not well integrated into Totem, yet.\r\n\r\nYou should be able to access all features (scanning for channels, recording/watching channels, browsing EPG and recordings) of the daemon directly within Totem. Ideally, the user just plugs in his DVB adapter and the assistant to scan for channels is started automatically if the device is not configured, yet.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Totem should use a ring buffer when watching live TV. This allows the user to pause live TV, rewind it and fast forward later. This feature will involve work on GStreamer's queue2 element.\r\n\r\nA simple channel list editor is currently missing, too. That's especially annoying with DVB-S where you have thousands of channels but you are only interested in a small fraction of them. It should be possible to select the favorite channels after the scan is completed.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I want to provide a way to aggregate EPG data from different sources with additional metadata via a plugin system. Some channels don't provide EPG data in their transport stream or the data is incomplete. Retrieving the EPG informations from an online service would obviously fix this problem and may even provide additional metadata.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, I want to add a way to schedule reoccurring recordings so you can easily record you favorite TV show.",

A user (admin) can join new pools, edit the relationship with different pools (like type of data to import, time lag for each sync attempt etc).\r\nSoftware which implements Zero Configuration runs continuously in the background. It has a search mechanism which is implemented by two tasks, 1: It exposes services with the name of all those pools which the instance of Sahana has subscribed to. 2: It 'searches' all those Sahana instances which have also subscribed to its pools. Once it finds servers which are in the same pool as it is, it fetches their database using Synchronization methodologies currently present (HTTP GET/POST). User can also specify server by IP/URL. Then it parses the XML and adds unique records in the database. At the time of installation, software needs to know administrative password of database.\r\n\r\n",

    "details": "According to the existing JSON support in Apache Axis2/Java, it deals with badgerfish[1] format of the JSON object which is an XML representation of JSON object. In the server side it converts that badgerfish string  to the relevant XML format and use it similarly as a normal XML SOAP message. As described in Axis2 documentation[1] it partially supports mapped format which is  another XML representation of JSON object too. But this JSON support can be improved to support pure JSON objects without using any format to covert it into a XML, as JSON is a light weighted alternative to XML. Therefore existing JSON support doesn't expose its advantages at all. \r\n\r\nHere I propose a solution to improve the existing JSON support of Axis2 with some limitations by using google-gson [2] library which is a rich library to convert a JSON string to a Java object and vice-versa. As this is also released under Apache license, using this library we can improve JSON support in Axis2 to overcome above problem.",

While it is hard to code python modules from scratch, ASCEND chose SWIG to bridge C/C++ and Python which is used by PYGTK. In ASCEND, we use SWIG to build a core PYTHON extension module called “ascpy” which is the adapter between the core calculation engine (libascend.so) and PYGTK-based user interface. This core adapter is mainly described by a SWIG interface file which currently contains lots of C++ style wrappers which make this SWIG interface file too long and not so easy for understanding. So the target is to makes these SWIG interface files “leaner and meaner”. This target can be achieved by clearing the C++ style wrappers in SWIG interface files and replacinge them with C wrappers contained by several SWIG interface files. The other possible way is to use CYTHON rewriting the interface between C/C++ and PYTHON. Anyway, no matter which method we choose, we should move on to make the GUI layer still works well because we actually changed the core adapter for PYTHON to use the core calculation engine.",

Nevertheless, it does not provide a safe way for building several ports simultaneously. Port’s dependencies are built sequentially. To maintain the system in consistent state while building several ports it is necessary to prevent concurrent access to shared files and directories from multiple processes. My approach is based on lock files, that serve both as barriers and critical section triggers for several concurrent processes. An important aspect of my project is dealing with various failures and unexpected terminations of port’s build process to avoid any deadlock situations and inconsistent state of the ports system. Firstly, my changes to the ports framework allow safe way to build and install several ports at the same time. Secondly, I designed a convenient approach for parallel port’s dependencies builds. The main aim of this project is to make system updates faster and easier. My modifications to the ports collection allow multicore servers to use all its potential both by installing several ports and several port’s dependencies simultaneously. Same goes for the Tinderbox and pointyhat systems used by port committers. Another benefit of my project is package building with pkgng, since the build systems can build packages in parallel.",

    "details": "The OLSRd mDNS plug-in allows the distribution of mDNS (multicast DNS i.e. avahi/bonjour/zeroconf) messages over an OLSR network. This is substantially achieved by sniffing for mDNS packets on the final users' networks (usually HNA networks), encapsulating them inside OLSR protocol messages, exploiting OLSR native message transfer mechanisms, and decapsulating the mDNS packets at all the other end users' networks. The plug-in has been developed by ninux.org members, however we would like to address some important issues that have arised during deployment: loops. If two mDNS plug-in enabled OLSR routers are attached to the same HNA network, then mDNS packets will loop back and forth between the two, also flooding the whole OLSR network. For the moment the temporary solution to this problem is to enable the plug-in on one router at a time on the same HNA. A real solution to the problem would be the following: usually mDNS packets have a TTL != 1, so: capture only mDNS packets with TTL != 1 when decapsulating mDNS packets, set TTL = 1 where TTL is the IP Time-to-live field capture rate. mDNS packets are incapsulated into OLSR messages, which in turn are contained in OLSR packets that are sent at the wireless basic rate (i.e. 1 or 2 Mbps) over the whole network. Thus a big amount of mDNS captured packets in a small time can slow down the whole network. A solution to this is to add a plug-in configuration option to set the maximum packet capture rate.",

In a nutshell, the goal of the project is to create an exhaustive database for entries, terms, words and the corresponding suggested translation for the same. This should also extend to work with small phrases and sentences.\r\n\tThe idea is to use a MT system on the existing localization work. Essentially, write scripts that would modify the existing localization work into a format suitable for MT system learning. These scripts will extend those that of \"Transvision\" which produces tmx files nightly. Based on the output of this step, a list will be created that would contain the entries, terms, words and the corresponding suggested translation. Corrections to this will be made, if any, manually. This then will be organized into a database along with a small web portal that will help contributors to l10n find words and preferred translations real easy. Again the working will be done using the Transvision portal as a base. At the outset the aim will be to do this for 4 languages (due to lingual restrictions in initial verification) but later extended to all languages supported by Mozilla. Finally, in addition to this quality comparison of suggestions from the tool compared to the already localized strings will be done and using the quality score from the MT system find if any inconsistencies exist in the localized strings. As can be seen, Transvision has partly achieved a few of the goals listed above. Hence, the plan is to leverage Transvision and extend it.\r\n",

Such multiple sequence\r\nalignments enable many kinds of analysis, including examination of the\r\nphylogenetic relationships between organisms, of conserved regions of\r\nDNA potentially indicating functionally important sequences, and\r\nmaking inferences about genomes by reference to more fully annotated\r\ngenomes (Blankenberg et al., 2011). Although BioRuby supports multiple\r\nsequence alignments through the bio-alignment gem, it does not\r\ncurrently support the MAF format. This project aims to rectify that by\r\ncreating a bio-alignment plugin to provide full MAF support from a\r\nnative BioRuby interface. This is particularly important as MAF files\r\ncan often be in the hundreds of gigabytes and are often queried and\r\nfiltered in a rich way; programmatic access to them is valuable for\r\nthe same reasons programmatic access to databases is\r\nindispensable. Having native BioRuby support for MAF will thus allow\r\nuse of the sizable BioRuby toolset with this data, and also make\r\nBioRuby a more viable tool for an important class of problems.\r\n",

It was built mainly to simplify biological data analysis workflows, for example by providing parsers for various data file formats, wrappers for command line programs, and interfaces for remote data sources. However, until now it still lacks a common framework for interacting with outputs of sequence search programs. These programs allow similarity-based searching across various biological sequence databases, a task inseparable from modern biology research. Unfortunately, extracting information from their outputs is often difficult due to the amount of results produced and the dense information packed with them. To solve this problem, this project aims to add a submodule called SearchIO to Biopython. SearchIO will allow more systematic information extraction from sequence-search programs’ outputs and an easier interaction with various output formats through a common programming interface. ",

Most of the times, it defeats the purpose of writing and making that projects. Hence, we require some system such that UI's do not pose obstacle in building such projects. \r\nEg, suppose you have a project which requires use of some plug-in which only has a qt front-end. Hence, all other users , like that of gnome, windows, mac, etc will be forced to use command line, or worse, settle themselves with default values, simply because UI of some plug-in or module does not work on their platform. It lets the users of the project down, and hence a lack of confidence in that project. Also, projects somewhere resist themselves in using such plugins. Similarly, oyranos colour management system is in parts only a thin layer between imaging applications and advanced modules or plug-ins. To deploy these plug-ins flexible and maintain toolkit independency, plug-ins must present some consistent UI.\r\nSimpleUI tries to solve this problem.

This problem can affect the accuracy and relevance of results inferred by semantic engines and leads to the requirement of using effective disambiguation techniques to process entities as part of the enhancement process in the semantic engines. This proposal focuses on using FOAF profiles as a datasource and process them to resolve name ambiguity problem in an effective way.\r\n \r\nFOAF is a vocabulary used to describe people, organizations and groups in the form of linked data to form an entity network on the web. The relationship of these FOAF instances can be very useful to derive new knowledge about entities using semantic techniques. Some of the FOAF instances may denote the same entity in different approaches with different information. Therefore it's essential to identify which FOAF instances are describing the same entity over the web and identify the co-reference relationship between them. The co-reference analysis can use FOAF attributes such as mbox, homepage, weblog, as unique identifiers (inverse functional properties) to match FOAF instances to identify co-referent clusters and use it to disambiguate entities over the web. This project aims to develop a comprehensive disambiguation algorithm by identifying and clustering co-referent FOAF instances which describes the same entity over the web. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, integration of FOAF profile support in Stanbol can be useful to develop a user network in content management systems and improve access control of content using social graph techniques.

At the same time, N64 is a full 64-bit address model which is comparable to x86_64 on x86. There is consensus that N32/N64 ABI would give capable devices better performance, while O32 ABI should be kept for devices that is only 32-bit capable. Since Multiarch support is almost available in Debian, we are able to apply the state-of-art technology to help us on both bootstrapping and future usages.

Several other data platforms are available, including the data management system developed at the German Neuroinformatics Node, which provides direct access to neuroscience data via a well-defined API. The aim of this project is to develop a client application that allows Dataspace users to search and access data at the G-Node, thus integrating available G-Node neuroscience data into the Dataspace federation.",

    "details": "An increasing number of studies are using large scale network models incorporating realistic connectivity to understand information processing in cortical structures. High performance computational resources are becoming more widely available to computational neuroscientists for this type of modeling and general purpose, well tested simulation environments such as NEURON and NEST are widely used. In addition, hardware solutions (based on custom neuromorphic hardware or off the shelf FPGA/GPU hardware) are in development, promising ever larger, faster simulations.\r\nHowever, there is a lack of well tested, community maintained network model examples which can work across all of these simulation solutions, which both incorporate realistic cell and network properties and provide networks of sufficient complexity to test the performance and scalability of these platforms. This work will involve converting a number of published cortical network models into open, simulator independent formats such as PyNN (http://neuralensemble.org/PyNN/), NeuroML (http://www.neuroml.org/) and NineML (http://software.incf.org/software/nineml), testing them across multiple simulator implementations and making them available to the community through the Open Source Brain repository (http://www.opensourcebrain.org/). By converting or implementing models into these simulator-independent formats the computational neuroscience community improves important aspects to the development of the field such as model transparency, accessibility and reuse.",

    "details": "LLVM-Polly is a promising polyhedral optimizer for data-locality and parallelism. However, experimental results show that Polly analysis and optimization can lead to significant compile-time overhead. On average, Polly optimization will increase the compile time by 393% for PolyBench benchmarks and by 53% for MediaBench benchmarks. That means if you want to gain from Polly, you have to pay 4 times extra compile-time overhead. Even if you do not want to gain much from Polly, you still have to pay 53% compile-time overhead. Such expensive compile-time overhead would make Polly much less attractive to LLVM users. I argue that maintaining fast compile time when Polly is enabled is very important, especially if we think of enabling Polly in default for all LLVM users. Based on this assumption, this project tries to reduce Polly compile-time overhead by revising a large number of Polly passes. First, I will revising some hot Polly passes that dominate the total compile-time overhead; Second, I will revisit Polly canonicalization passes and try to let the Polly bail out early, so Polly will not cause much overhead when it cannot optimize program; Third, I will revisit and improve Polly optimization passes and code generation passes, so Polly can be much faster when it can optimize program. I hope this project can benefit both LLVM users and Polly users. For LLVM users who care more about compile-time overhead, it enables Polly to provide extra performance gains within little extra compile-time overhead. For Polly users who care more about code quality, this project will significantly reduce the compile-time overhead without performance loss.",

The advantage of using a partitioning scheme is that each subset of sites can be independently modeled, which can have a substantial impact on the results of a phylogenetic analysis. PartitionFinder currently requires that the user predefine subsets (they often choose to do so by gene or codon position). Such assignments can often be arbitrary and may not result in the best fit model. This is especially true for alignments that include several different types of data (ultra conserved elements, introns, etc.), which are becoming increasingly common.

Games can gain lot of performance by reducing faraway models and Ogre provides two methods for this: Manually created mesh LOD (for example in Blender) and generated mesh LOD. Blender supports nice reduction algorithms, why don't we just use that? First manually created mesh LOD creates a separated mesh for each LOD level, which means vertex data is duplicated for each LOD, which makes a big memory overhead. The memory overhead is needed, because Blender moves the vertices from original position to a calculated new position, so we need a separated vertex buffer too. Why don't we use Hoppe's algorithm or other more advanced techniques for reduction? These techniques have got the same problem as Blender. Also it would add limitations: For example if the mesh has bone weights or custom vertex data passed to a vertex shader than you can’t just insert a vertex.

A naive approach yields too\r\nmany memory operations resulting in a reduced execution speed. The\r\ncurrently implemented SBCL register allocator performs only graph\r\ncoloring, essentially treating spills by coloring with stack slots. In\r\norder to improve the allocator, we propose to integrate a new\r\nheuristic graph coloring method inspired by the concepts introduced by\r\nBriggs et al. (1994) in the SBCL compiler.  According to Briggs'\r\nresults of the optimistic coloring, the proposed enhancements can be\r\nexpected to increase performance of produced code by up to 15\\%.\r\n",

For this, several wiselib applications need to be implemented for the different sensor node platforms, which expose the fundamental functions of the node hardware (such as: send(), receive(), getSensorValue() or switchOnLed()) to a Control Server, which is connected to all nodes via the testbed infrastructure. The Control Server then exposes these interfaces via a JavaScript interface, which allows the remote development and debugging of a sensor node application inside the browser of the programmer, enabling the interactive reprogramming of the nodes at runtime.\" - http://www.wiselib.org/gsoc/project_ideas.html",

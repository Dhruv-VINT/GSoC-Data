These explicit parallelism features make it easier to reason about the parallelism in your algorithm and program.\nData and Task Locality\nWhen working on a large machine, the location of some data relative to the task which uses it or other data with which it must work plays a key role in performance. Chapel provides features which allow you to control that placement, both within a data structure and outside it.\nMultiresolution Philosophy\nChapel is designed around a multiresolution philosophy, permitting users to initially write very abstract code and then incrementally add more detail until they are as close to the machine as their needs require.\nModern Language Features\nChapel supports code reuse and rapid prototyping via object-oriented design, type inference, and features for generic programming.\nInteroperability\nExisting code from other languages can be integrated into Chapel programs (or vice-versa) via interoperability features.\n", "URL": "https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/organizations/5677337046155264", "Technologies": ["chapel", "python", "high performance computing", "c", "c++"], "Topics": ["programming languages", "compilers", "high performance computing", "distributed computing", "parallel computing"], "Mailing-list": "", "IRC": "", "contact": "mailto:chapel-gsoc@cray.com", "Idea-page": "http://chapel-lang.org/gsoc"}, {"Organization": "Checker Framework", "About": "We are a group of developers who are passionate about code quality.  We have built an innovative lightweight verification tool called the Checker Framework.\nThe Checker Framework helps you prevent bugs at development time, before they escape to production.  It is based on the idea of pluggable type-checking.  Pluggable type-checking replaces a programming language's built-in type system with a more powerful, expressive one.\nJava's type system prevents some bugs, such as int count = \"hello\";.  However, it does not prevent other bugs, such as null pointer dereferences, concurrency errors, disclosure of private information, incorrect internationalization, out-of-bounds indices, etc.\nThe Checker Framework enables you to create a more powerful type system and use it in place of Java's.  The more powerful type system is not just a bug-finding tool:  it is a verification tool that gives a guarantee that no errors (of certain types) exist in your program.  Even though it is powerful, it is easy to use.  It follows the standard typing rules that programmers already know, and it fits into their workflow.  We have created around 20 new type systems, and other people have created many more.\nThe Checker Framework is popular:  it is successfully used on hundreds of projects at Google, Amazon, Uber, on Wall Street, and in other companies from big to small.  It it attractive to programmers who care about their craft and the quality of their code.  The Checker Framework is the motivation for Java's type annotations feature.

Idiomatic D programs are commonly as fast as hand-optimized C code, while being reportedly shorter and easier to write, read, and change. A gradual approach to memory safety allows safe programs to be largely automatically checked, whilst relying on small and fast manually-verified primitives.\nMetaprogramming in the D language relies on three core features. First, compile-time evaluation allows user code to evaluate most D code (except calls into opaque functions or certain casts) during compilation. This allows for unparalleled compile-time processing abilities, without the need to learn a different metalanguage. Second, static introspection allows D artifacts (such as modules, types, functions) to be inspected during compilation. This allows for component designs that adapt to one another at assemblage time, eliminating the rigidity of fixed interfaces - a paradigm becoming increasingly known as \"Design by Introspection\". Third, the D language allows strings computed during compilation to be fed back to the compiler. This allows arbitrarily complex code to be built from compact specifications such as regular expressions, EBNF/PEG grammars, SQL, automata, and many other DSLs. Each of these three pillars is enabled by the others, and the absence of any one of them would hamstring the power of the others.\nD's rich feature set offers many opportunities to a variety of projects, without them being ostensibly related to advanced metaprogramming facilities. High-performance code can be terse and highly optimized without the tedium of repeated coding patterns or hand-written specializations. Highly dynamic code can combine static and dynamic language features in an expressive whole. The best, most innovative ways to use the D language are yet to be discovered.\nYou can learn more about D's feature set and design at dlang.org\n", "URL": "https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/organizations/6223494952517632", "Technologies": ["dlang", "linux", "windows", "osx", "bsd"], "Topics": ["programming languages", "object-oriented programming", "functional programming", "web programming", "system programming"], "Mailing-list": "", "IRC": "", "contact": "mailto:gsoc@dlang.rocks", "Idea-page": "https://wiki.dlang.org/GSOC_2019_Ideas"}, {"Organization": "DBpedia", "About": "DBpedia data is served as Linked Data, which is revolutionizing the way applications interact with the Web.

Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.\nThere are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Subversion servers for experimental and third party development.

It quickly became and remains one of the most important reference databases in genomics, following the rapid development of the field. Its initial mission included finding all of the genes in the human genome. A year later, the mouse genome was published and we developed tools to directly compare genomes across species. Over the following decade, sequencing capacity increased exponentially (faster that Moore's Law in fact) and large surveys started examining more species and more individuals within each species. Our mission therefore expanded to store these datasets and statistics efficiently. Finally, in recent years, sequencing has been used to study the biochemical activity of the DNA molecule within the different tissues of an individual, prompting us to extend yet again our remit.\nAt the same time, Ensembl is an evolving software development project. Over 15 years, we moved from a central relational MySQL database with a Perl API and static web pages, to an array of storage technologies with a RESTful interface and an interactive front-end. We have dedicated portals for the large clades on the tree of life (known as Ensembl Genomes). Our annotations are produced through centuries of CPU time, coordinated by our powerful eHive analysis workflow manager.\nToday, we are a team of nearly 90 full time staff, housed at the European Bioinformatics Institute, and we collaborate with many external contributors around the world, in particular via our Github repositories where you can see us work day-to-day.

Users can automatically generate code to run queries using our client libraries in R, Python, Perl, Ruby, Java, and Javascript.\nWhat technologies do we use?\nThe InterMine core is built in Java, and all data are stored in PostgreSQL. We have a legacy JSP-based user interface, with a Clojurescript user interface in early beta. We're also keen on browser-based datavis tools that use our API, so you'll see a lot of Javascript (or languages that compile to Javascript, like Clojurescript and Coffeescript). Our client libraries provide opportunities to write code in several other languages.\nWhat sort of data does InterMine have?\nSince InterMine is open source, many research organisations around the world run InterMines with their own organisms, ranging from mice and fruit flies to a broad range of plants. Visit the InterMine Registry to see them all. (The registry was a GSoC project!) Most InterMines also have a \"data sources\" tab which tells you more about where the data in that specific instance originates.\nWhat kind of problems does InterMine solve?\nGenomic data is often messy, and there is a lot of it. Scientists use different terms to mean the same thing, and even assign the same gene different names! We aim to help scientists make sense of such ambiguity, diversity and complexity.\nOne way to help is to provide visualisations, so we\u2019re always excited to add and adapt different ways to display our data.

We campaign for these freedoms because we believe that everyone deserves them.\nThough the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates practically into wider compatibility, more utility, and no end-user lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better-quality, higher-reliability, increased-security, and greater-flexibility than proprietary alternatives. LibreOffice is a large project (approx. 6MLOC), which makes it interestingly complex, but at the same time, provides a place for all sorts of contribution & skills.\nThe community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to continue developing our software.

However, in many cases, screen reading software costs more than the computer itself. In the past, this has left computers inaccessible to millions of blind people around the world. This is a critical problem, because without computers, access to education and employment is severely limited, not to mention everyday tasks such as online banking, shopping and accessing the news.\nIn April 2006, two blind programmers, Michael Curran and James Teh, began to develop a free screen reader called NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access) for use with computers running Microsoft Windows. They then founded the not-for-profit organisation NV Access to support the development of the NVDA screen reader.\nNVDA has been translated by volunteers into more than 50 languages, and used by people in more than 120 countries. It has also won multiple awards.\nNVDA allows blind and vision impaired people to access and interact with the Windows operating system and many third party applications.\nMajor highlights include:\n\nSupport for popular applications including web browsers such as Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, email clients, internet chat software, music players, and office programs such as Microsoft Word and Excel\nA built-in speech synthesizer supporting over 50 languages, plus support for many other 3rd party voices\nReporting of textual formatting where available such as font name and size, style and spelling errors\nSupport for many refreshable braille displays, including input of Braille via braille displays that have a braille keyboard\nAbility to run entirely from a USB flash drive or other portable media without the need for installation\nEasy to use talking installer\nSupport for modern Windows Operating Systems including both 32 and 64 bit variants\nAbility to run at Windows logon and other secure screens\n\n", "URL": "https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/organizations/5392062852104192", "Technologies": ["python", "c++", "ui automation", "iaccessible2", "win32 api"], "Topics": ["accessibility", "blindness", "screen reader", "braille", "text to speech"], "Mailing-list": "https://sourceforge.net/p/nvda/lists/nvda-devel/", "IRC": "", "contact": "mailto:info@nvaccess.org", "Idea-page": "https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/wiki/GSOC-2019-Ideas-List"}, {"Organization": "Open Astronomy", "About": "OpenAstronomy is a collaboration between open source astronomy and astrophysics projects that are used by researchers and engineers around the world to study our universe either by analysing the data obtained from amazing instruments like the Hubble Space Telescope, the Square Kilometer Array or the Solar Dynamic Observatory, developing very sophisticated numerical models (eg.

Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases...if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as an open source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide which rises all ships. Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in dozens of developing countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and India.\n", "URL": "https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/organizations/6088660628275200", "Technologies": [" java", " javascript", "spring", "mysql", " android"], "Topics": ["science and medicine", "open source", "medical record", "developing countries"], "Mailing-list": "", "IRC": "", "contact": "mailto:community@openmrs.org", "Idea-page": "https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/RES/Summer+Of+Code+2019"}, {"Organization": "OpenStreetMap", "About": "OpenStreetMap is a crowdsourcing project that creates and distributes free geographic data for the world.

The main objective of the project, called ProvinciaWiFi (later renamed WiFi Metropolitano), was to take a decisive step to reduce the existing digital divide by fostering and facilitating the use of ICT by citizens.\nFrom the outset it was decided to commit the project to a completely open philosophy. For this reason a clear choice towards open software and operating systems and the availability of every modification, update and improvement to the community was made. The same approach was adopted for the knowledge and the experience acquired within the project. In order to pursue this goals the Province of Rome called the university consortium CASPUR (later merged in the CINECA consortium) to develop the technical solution. In this context, a research project conducted by the CINECA consortium found its perfect application. This project proposed an innovative methodology for the distribution of networks (more precisely Virtual LANs used for Wi-Fi connectivity) between geographically distant sites.\nThe methodology adopted made it possible to host public connectivity services on non-dedicated network infrastructures (e.g.: private xDSL) that for technical and legal reasons could not be used as such. \u2028This is not the sole advantage that OpenWISP gave to WiFi Metropolitano: embracing the resource-sharing philosophy \u2013 typical of open projects \u2013 anyone can contribute to the network expansion simply by hosting an access point.\n\u2028The software tools and the architectures, including the OpenWISP 2 wifi controller and different NetJSON implementations used in OpenWISP,  are released to the public free of charge under open-source licenses, we hope this will allow a broader audience to benefit from this work and improve upon it.\n", "URL": "https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/organizations/4578309608833024", "Technologies": ["python", "django", "javascript", "ansible", "openwrt"], "Topics": ["networking", "wifi", "iot", "configu", "telecom"], "Mailing-list": "", "IRC": "", "contact": "mailto:community@openmrs.org", "Idea-page": "http://openwisp.org/gsoc/ideas-2019.html"}, {"Organization": "Oppia Foundation", "About": "Why Oppia?\nOppia\u2019s aim is to provide personalized tutoring to every single person in the world, especially those whose educational needs are not currently being served well.

Learners (users who visit Oppia to learn something) explore a new topic through an exploration. Explorations can have multiple paths the learner may take depending on their answers (similar to video games). Different answers result in Oppia responding differently.\nA user may repeatedly struggle on a certain question. Oppia can detect this and branch away from the current topic, so that learners may practice fundamentals before attempting that question again. Oppia aims to act like a tutor, an educational guide who can help learners practice topics and watch for any mistakes they might make. One of the most important roles of Oppia is to gently show learners where they went wrong and instruct them on a correct approach.\nCommunity-driven lesson creation\nThe other half of Oppia is a community of creators (users who create explorations). Oppia offers tools for creating new explorations with the goal of allowing anyone to teach just about anything. Creating explorations is very much like creating a video game, and we face some similar challenges.

Many monitor tools are available as part of the core PCP release, while other (typically graphical) monitoring tools are available separately in the PCP GUI or PCP WebApp packages.\nThe PCP architecture is distributed in the sense that any PCP tool may be executing remotely.

With the GStreamer Editing Services library, we are laying solid foundations for the future based upon over a decade of experience. Built atop the giant shoulders of the industry-standard GStreamer multimedia framework, GES reduces fragmentation and risk while allowing diversity for application writers and adaptability for all kinds of purposes.\nThe pipeline-based GStreamer multimedia framework is in use on most of the Linux systems. Not only that, but GStreamer is cross-platform, and is also used on embedded devices. Thus, lots of people benefit when we fix a bug upstream, in GStreamer, or push for new features to cover the demanding video-editing use-case.\nIn addition to GStreamer's own codecs and video/audio effects, we can easily use other framework's codecs and effects, such as FFMPEG and Frei0r, through various GStreamer plugins available in the good/bad/ugly collections. You have any multimedia building-block you might want in Pitivi.\nTooling\nThe many dependent libraries make video editing apps very complex.

We\u2019re looking forward to our members in Africa and Asia! We use a variety of means to communicate, including a Google Group for announcements and a forum for discussions.\nPANOPTES occupies a unique niche in the ongoing search for exoplanets. Previous missions, such as Kepler, have focused primarily on one region of the sky, taking deep images in order to discover transiting exoplanets around mostly distant stars, leading to limited opportunities for imaging follow up as the majority of the targets are far away and dim. Current projects aim to fill this gap by targeting relatively bright and near stars, but continue to utilize expensive equipment and optimal site locations in order to ensure success, thus limiting the ability of the project to grow and adapt.\nPANOPTES is attractive because it can complement these missions, doing so cheaply and with the involvement of citizen scientists. And while the primary scientific interest of the PANOPTES project is to aid in the discovery of exoplanets via the transit-detection technique, PANOPTES is also a platform. We encourage other groups to come up with projects which use PANOPTES data, hardware or software to address other scientific questions, such as supernovae, near-earth objects (NEO), space debris, and more.

The project started in 2001 and we recently widened our scope to RPG engines.\nResidualVM is a sister project of ScummVM games and was created in 2003. ResidualVM shares large blocks of common code with ScummVM, some developers and even a mentor.\n\nScummVM supports classic 2D adventure games such as Monkey Island, Simon the Sorcerer, Space Quest, and many more. We have also started work to support 2D RPG games such as Dungeon Master. To this end, the Virtual Machines (called Engines) are complete reimplementations in C++ of the engines used in the original games. The number of engines is constantly growing thanks to a very agile and diversified development team and ScummVM is currently able to run more than 200 games. The VM approach followed by ScummVM results in efficient code, which has been ported to numerous Operating Systems (over 30). ScummVM has a highly productive team of about 45 currently active developers (out of an all-time pool of over 130), working together on a codebase of 2,800,000 lines of code. In addition ScummVM has many non-developer contributors, and a huge and highly active community.\n\nResidualVM is a cross-platform 3D game interpreter which allows you to play some 3D adventure games, such as Cyan's Myst 3 and LucasArts' Lua-based 3D adventures: Grim Fandango and Escape from Monkey Island, provided you already have their data files.

Many individuals & organizations do not realize they are a target, nor understand who is attacking them, how, or why. We provide this information, so people can better understand that they are a target, and understand the basic measures they can take to mitigate these threats. This is provided through our Know Your Enemy series of papers.\nTools - For organizations interested in continuing their own research about cyber threats, we provide the tools and techniques we have developed. All tools are specifically licensed open source. Organizations all over the world use our tools.\nInformation - In addition to raising awareness, we provide details to better secure assets. Historically, information about attackers has been limited to the tools they use. We provide critical additional intelligence, such as their motives in attacking, how they communicate, when they attack systems and their actions after compromising a system. We provide this service through our Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our periodic Scan of the Month challenges.\nThe Honeynet Project uses GSoC as a incubator for new R&D projects, and to recruit active new members.\n", "URL": "https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/organizations/6462296409243648", "Technologies": ["python", "go", " c/c++", "linux", "data analysis"], "Topics": ["honeynets", "honeypots", "deception", "research", "malware"], "Mailing-list": "", "IRC": "", "contact": "mailto:project@honeynet.org", "Idea-page": "https://gsoc.honeynet.org"}, {"Organization": "The Java Pathfinder Team", "About": "The Java Pathfinder project (JPF) was initially conceived and developed at NASA Ames Research Center in 1999.

There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence we host a number of such extension projects on our own, public JPF server, together with a Wiki that provides a central location for learning about, obtaining, and contributing to JPF.\nJPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android. JPF is constantly being extended with support for verification of new types of properties and for new types of application domains.\n", "URL": "https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/organizations/4859784585543680", "Technologies": ["java", "jvm", "bytecode", "android", "distributed systems"], "Topics": ["testing", "software model checking", "program analysis", "concurrency", "virtual machine"], "Mailing-list": "", "IRC": "", "contact": "mailto:project@honeynet.org", "Idea-page": "https://github.com/javapathfinder/jpf-core/wiki/GSoC-2019-Project-Ideas"}, {"Organization": "The Julia Language", "About": "Julia is a programming language for ease of use and performance, which is rapidly gaining momentum in all kinds of technical and scientific computing.

The goal of the Vega project is to promote an ecosystem of usable and interoperable visualization tools, supporting use cases ranging from exploratory data analysis to effective communication via custom visualization design. This goal has led us to develop not a singular system, but rather a stack of tools for interactive data visualization. At the foundation of this stack is the Vega visualization grammar. Similar to how SQL provides a language for expressing database queries, Vega provides a declarative language for describing interactive visualizations with primitive building blocks such as data, transforms, marks, and event streams. On top of Vega, Vega-Lite provides a concise language for rapidly generating statistical graphics to support data analysis. With Vega and Vega-Lite, we have built a number of graphical user interfaces including the Voyager visualization tool, which blends manual and automated chart authoring to facilitate exploratory data analysis.

Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.\nOverview\nCurrently in the web, modules are not fully adopted, and therefore we need tooling to help compile your module code into something that will work in the browser. webpack champions this by not only supporting CommonJS, AMD, RequireJS module systems, but also ECMAScript Modules (ESM).\nWhat makes webpack unique?\nExtensibility webpack is built using an extensible event-driven architecture. This means that a majority of our code is Plugins that hook into a set of lifecycle events. This means that it is infinitely flexible and configurable. This architecture also lets us pivot very quickly. Plugins isolate functionality (and can even be used in your configuration), and allow us to add and drop new functionality without breaking the rest of the system.\nFocused around Web Performance webpack revived a classic technique from Google Web Toolkit known as \"code splitting\". Code splitting let's developers write imperative instructions (as a part of their code), to split up their JavaScript bundles (at build time) into multiple pieces that can be loaded lazily.\nBuilt in JavaScript webpack's configuration format, and architecture is all built and run on NodeJS. This means that anyone comfortable with JavaScript can break open our source code with a low level of entry to learn, contribute to, and improve.\nUsed at Scale webpack is used by companies like AirBnB, Microsoft, Housing.com, Flipkart, Alibaba, to build high performance, scaled web applications.\nCommunity Owned webpack is not backed by a single organization, rather by its users, contributors, backers, sponsors, and shareholders. This means that every decision we make is for them, and them only. We are funded by these same people as they help us improve and double down on their investment in their most important tooling.\n", "URL": "https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/organizations/5974651593818112", "Technologies": ["javascript", "web development", "webasssembly", "node.js", "html5/css3"], "Topics": ["programming languages and development tools", "tooling", "toolchains", "compilers", "parser"], "Mailing-list": "", "IRC": "", "contact": "mailto:webpack@opencollective.com", "Idea-page": "https://docs.google.com/document/d/19ZCaBt5UQJ45reIpCKQo_oeICpk9sPW5YjqO7ciAQh4/edit?usp=sharing"}, {"Organization": "Wikimedia Foundation", "About": "Wikimedia envisions a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge.

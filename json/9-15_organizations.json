Development continues to be active, with several new features having been added over the course of the last six months, and we are still seeing strong continuing interest from the community. We are very eager to build up ASCEND as a alternative to the spreadsheet, with the benefits of visible/'readable' model structure and improved reusability that it offers to technical users.  http://ascendwiki.cheme.cmu.edu/ASCEND_history",

Strength of the project is reflected in application of  Wesnoth Markup Language (WML), which provides a simple language to easily customize scenarios. It has created a significant modding community that has generated a considerable amount of user content.The first stable release (1.0) was on October 2 2005, with the latest  stable release (1.6) announced on Sunday, March 22. According to Ohloh, a site that collects activity statistics on open-source projects, the Wesnoth development effort is in the top 2% of largest and most active projects.Wesnoth has grown substantially and is considered one of the largest open source games around.",

    "about": "The Berkman Center was founded to explore cyberspace, share in its study, and help pioneer its development. We represent a network of faculty, students, fellows, entrepreneurs, lawyers, and virtual architects working to identify and engage with the challenges and opportunities of cyberspace.  We investigate the real and possible boundaries in cyberspace between open and closed systems of code, of commerce, of governance, and of education, and the relationship of law to each. We do this through active rather than passive research, believing that the best way to understand cyberspace is to actually build out into it.  Our faculty, fellows, students, and affiliates engage with a wide spectrum of Net issues, including governance, privacy, intellectual property, antitrust, content control, and electronic commerce. Our diverse research interests cohere in a common understanding of the Internet as a social and political space where constraints upon inhabitants are determined not only through the traditional application of law, but, more subtly, through technical architecture (\"code\").  There are several code development projects at the Center, and some of the opportunities to contribute to these are listed on our ideas page.  They include the StopBadware project (conducted in partnership with Google), the Internet & Democracy project (surveying global internet freedom), Media Cloud (doing automated content analysis and visualization on the news), and Cohort (a rails-based CRM).",

Participating faculty  represent nearly every college of the University. The Center is based on the recognition that many different kinds of systems which include self-regulation, feedback or adaptation in their dynamics, may have a common underlying structure despite their apparent differences. Moreover, these deep structural similarities can be exploited to transfer methods of analysis and understanding from one field to another. In addition to developing  deeper understandings of specific systems, interdisciplinary approaches should  help elucidate the general structure and behavior of complex systems, and move us toward a deeper appreciation of the general nature of such systems.",

From 2001 to 2006, the project grew a substantial code base (approximately 350,000 LOC), user community (over 800 users of the \"public\" Version 7 Hackystat server, with an undetermined additional number of users on private servers), and developers (dozens of contributors to the code base from approximately 20 academic and industry sites). A significant number of publications occurred during this time (a partial list of which is available at http://code.google.com/p/hackystat/wiki/Publications).  In addition, there was one commercial, non-open source spin-off based upon a subset of this project called Sixth Sense Analytics (http://www.6thsenseanalytics.com/).

    "about": "Mercurial is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS), and we would like to participate in 2009's Summer of Code. In recent years (notably since the Linux kernel project started looking for a new VCS), DVCSs have rapidly started to gain traction. For open source projects, especially, the use of a distributed system can be a great enabler, in that it's much easier to keep track of your own changes and publish them back to the community in a structured way. With centralized systems, you have a central repository that only a happy few have (write) access to, and people spend a lot of time mailing around diffs. With distributed systems, everyone has their own branch, and it's very easy to publish it on the web, compare the changes to those on some other branch or merge two branches back together. This has worked especially well since good DVCS hosting providers have come into being, like GitHub and Bitbucket.  Written largely in Python (with the exceptions of a few performance-critical core modules), it is easy to develop for and allows for good code organization and clean abstractions. Moreover, it has been optimized from the start for good performance, using an append-only datastore, minimizing random disk access and smart uses of compression. Finally, it has extensive features for sharing changesets, over HTTP, SSH and in files over email and has an innovative extension (Mercurial Queues) to help building and organizing changesets into a thoroughly useful source history.",

This may include topics such as: voice/handwriting/gesture recognition, touch computing, computer vision, and information visualization.   Our members consist of students, researchers, software engineers, interaction and user interface designers all working together towards a better understanding of HCI. Our current focus is \"Open Source Interface\" which is solely for accelerating development of existing hardware and sensing solutions, thus allowing us to find the cheapest and most effective ways to construct our input devices.    One very important aspect of our community is to create and utilize open standards that allows for development and innovation to flourish. For example, we use the TUIO protocol, which is the standard for tangible object communications. Another crucial standard that must be created in an open environment is \"Gesture Standards\", which allows for fluid interaction across devices.    We are currently maintaining a set of open source projects including:  T-Beta – cross-platform computer vision framework (GSoC 2008 project)  Touchlib - first open source library for multi-touch screen operation working under Linux and Windows  touche – multi-touch application suite for Mac OS X BBTouch -  multi-touch framework for Mac OS X pyMT – multi-touch library and set of applications written in Python OpenTouch - multi-touch library for Mac OS X (WinLibre GSoC 2007 Best Success) TouchAPI- a library which allows for rapid prototyping of NUI client applications in Adobe Flash/Flex/AIR or Silverlight/WPF QMTSim – TUIO Simulator written in C++ using Qt library (GSoC 2008 project) TUIO Simulator - Java TUIO protocol simulator allowing you to test your multitouch apps without a hardware input device (written by reactivision project team)  Other than the above mentioned projects, we are also looking forward to working with other open source projects like reactivision, libavg, opentable and many more that are widely used and developed by NUI Group members. For example, we have recently started to work on applications for iPhone/iPod Touch using the iPhone SDK and have hopes of innovative project proposals from the community.

    "about": "Our world continues to be ravaged by a pandemic of epic proportions, as over 40 million people are infected with or dying from HIV/AIDS -- most (up to 95%) are in developing countries.  Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers.  Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases...if anything at all.  To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts.  As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide which rises all ships. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (http://regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (http://pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy.  These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments.  To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in several developing countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and Kerala.  This work is supported in part by organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the Rockefeller Foundation, the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).",

They record street names, village names and other features using notebooks, digital cameras, and voice-recorders. Back at the computer, contributors upload those GPS logs showing where they traveled, and trace-out the roads on OpenStreetMap's collaborative database. Using their notes, contributors add the street names, information such as the type of road or path, and the connections between roads. That data is then processed to produce detailed street-level maps, which can be published freely on sites such as Wikipedia, used to create handheld or in-car navigation devices, or printed and copied without restriction.",

Pardus, the distribution, is the main tool to achieve these goals, and has, in turn, three fundamental requirements: Having full Turkish (i.e. mostly UTF-8) support, ease of use and installation, and a human-centric and task-based design approach (instead of a technology-centric and tool-based one). Pardus project has been launched in Fall 2003 and the technical roadmap has been laid of in Fall 2004. The Pardus developers consist of 15 TUBITAK UEKAE employed core developers (10 full-time, 2 part-time) and more  than 30 community developers.

In particular, we tend to focus on small-scale or individual, risky but promising open source \"seed\" projects that we think will grow into something great.  We like to mentor projects in the technology end of the open source space, including Linux kernel driver work and open hardware/software systems work with a solid code component. That said, a number of our projects have been at the applications level as well; one of our strengths is the ability to track down mentors for a wide variety of different kinds of activity.

RTEMS (Real-Time Executive for Multiprocessor Systems) is a free real-time operating system designed for deeply embedded systems. It is a free open source solution that supports multi-processor systems and has been ported to over a dozen CPU architectures and includes support for over 100 boards.  RTEMS is designed to support applications with the most stringent real-time requirements while being compatible with open standards such as POSIX.  RTEMS includes optional functional features such as TCP/IP and various file systems while still offering minimum executable sizes under 20 KB in useful configurations.  Many RTEMS developers are active in the free software community and contribute to various projects including binutils, gcc, newlib, and gdb.  The RTEMS Maintainer is also a member of the GCC Steering Committee.  RTEMS development is done in a cross-compilation fashion. The RTEMS Project maintains an APT/Yum Repository with RPMs for various i386 and x86_64 GNU/Linux distributions including Fedora, RHEL, CentOS, and SUSE.  In addition, MS-Windows is supported via MinGW hosted toolsets.  RTEMS tools are included in various BSD ports collection.  Our package maintainer contributes to the Fedora project.  We have recently put together some flyers for projects that use RTEMS.  Please visit http://www.rtems.org/flyers.html and see how a relatively unknown piece of open source software is such an important part of the scientific community.  We are proud that in April 2009, the ESA Herschel and Planck satellites will launch and both are using RTEMS.   Please note that GPL+exception was not an option for the license category.  Most of RTEMS uses a GPL+linking exception.  This makes it possible for closed source applications to be linked statically with RTEMS.

Currently, the project is made up of three different components: Enlightenment DR16, Enlightenment DR17, and the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries.

Presently, in development towards the DR17 Desktop Shell, we have created an entirely new set of libraries and tools that provide more power and flexibility than any other group of graphical libraries available:  the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries.  These libraries offer such functionality as an X11 canvas library (Evas), X11 abstraction layer (Ecore), and an canvas based interface layout library (Edje) that allows separation of interface and application logic (thus making every application that uses it \"skinable\").  These libraries are extremely fast and lightweight.  So much so they have been adopted by many other organizations.  Most notably, organizations such as Openmoko (http://illume.projects.openmoko.org/), Maemo (http://maemo-efl.garage.maemo.org/), Terrasoft (http://www.terrasoftsolutions.com/products/ydl/e17/), the Canola (http://openbossa.indt.org.br/canola/developer.html) project), and more.",

Tux Paint is enjoyable for everyone from the youngest children capable of using computers up through adults. Tux Math (originally written by Bill Kendrick, now led by David Bruce and Tim Holy) is a video game-style math drill program.  It covers basic math operations up through topics such as negative numbers, factoring, and order-of-operations exercises.  Tux Typing (originally written by Sam Hart, now led by David Bruce) offers word typing practice in the setting of two video game-type activities, as well as phrase and sentence typing for older students.  All three programs are SDL-based C apps, licensed under the GPL.  They are developed natively on Linux and are included in all major desktop distributions, as well as non-Linux Free Software collections such as the FreeBSD Ports Collection and the MacPorts project for OS-X.  Builds are also available for Microsoft Windows and BeOS.  The aim is to avoid specific platform dependencies so the programs can be made available as widely as possible, including the computing environments that children are most likely to actually encounter in schools.

We expect the following development cycle (1.9, leading to 1.10) to premier significant changes in gameplay, UI, and development tools, with many new concepts being introduced.

We have a storyline that we try to make strong enough to be appealing to people who are more after roleplaying than hack'n'slash. The development team is currently made of around four people - two coders, and two people taking care of game content, and we get occasional contributions from many other people. Those contributions notably include music tracks, levels, and graphics. All of us are volunteers.

The IDI educates developers about accessibility issues and why it is necessary, not only from a legal perspective but also from a social perspective, that people with disabilities not be excluded from everyday social activity, including access to information and the Internet.  The institute is located at the Ontario College of Art and Design (OCAD) (formerly at the University of Toronto).

The IDI is made up of 8 collaborating institutions including Ryerson University, York University, University of Ontario Institute of Technology, Ontario College of Art and Design, George Brown College, Seneca College, Sheridan College and University of Toronto.  In addition to developing leading edge software, the IDI plays a key role in introducing accessibility into emerging international standards. Such standards include those of the W3C, playing a significant role in the organization's Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), of the IMS Global Learning Consortium, the IDI being largely responsible for the introduction of the IMS AccessForAll standards (AFA), and of ISO, playing a lead role in the introduction and development of the FDIS 24751 collection of accessibility standards.",

NUI Group is also a world wide community, which offers a collaborative environment for developers that are interested in learning and sharing new HCI (Human Computer Interaction) methods and concepts. This may include topics such as: voice/handwriting/gesture recognition, touch computing, computer vision, and information visualization.   Our current focus is \"Open Source Interface\", which is solely for accelerating development of existing hardware and sensing solutions, Thus allowing us to find the cheapest and most effective ways to construct our input devices. This project is truly amazing, which attracts a variety of people from around the globe. We are students, researchers, interaction designers, user interface designers, software engineers working on opens source hardware and software solutions.   With over 8000 NUI Group members all over the world we are changing ways of human computer interaction. One very important aspect of this project is to create and utilize open standards that allows software development to flourish. For example, we use the TUIO protocol, which is the standard for tabletop communication. Another crucial standard that must be created in an open environment is \"Gesture Standards\", which allows for fluid interaction across input devices. Our doors are always open and we are looking for new people with similar interests and dreams. We believe that community is more powerful than money or technology.  Our main project CCV has opened up computer vision to a new audience lowering the bar for new researchers in the field and we have solely GSoC to thank for this.   We are mainly maintaining a set of open source projects including:   Community Core Vision (CCV) – cross-platform computer vision framework (GSoC 2008/2009 project) Touchlib - first open source library for multi-touch screen operation working under Linux and Windows Touch'e – multi-touch framework for Mac OS X BBTouch -  multi-touch framework for Mac OS X PyMT Paint – multi-touch library and set of applications written in Python (GSoC 2009 project) OpenTouch - WinLibre GSoC 2007 Best Success - multi-touch library for Mac OS X (GSoC 2008 project) TouchAPI- a library which allows for rapid prototyping of multi-touch client applications in Adobe Flash/Flex/AIR or Silverlight/WPF QMTSim – TUIO simulator written in C++ using Qt library (GSoC 2008 project) TUIO Simulator - Java TUIO protocol simulator allowing you to test your multitouch apps without multitouch screen (written by reactivision project team)   Other than just mentioned projects, we are also looking forward to work with other open source projects like reactivision, libavg, opentable and many more that are widely created and used by NUI Group members.

    "about": "The Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV)is an open, free for commercial use, computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV contains a comprehensive set of both classic and state of the art computer vision and machine learning algorithms. These algorithms can be used, for example, to detect and recognize faces, identify objects, classify human actions in videos, track camera movements, track moving objects, extract 3D models of objects, produce 3D point clouds from stereo cameras, stitch images together to produce a high resolution image of an entire scene, find similar images from an image database, remove red eye from images taken using flash, follow eye movements, recognize scenes and establish markers to overlay the scenes with augmented reality to name a few. OpenCV has well over 2 million downloads, has an active user group with over 41 thousand registered members. The O'Reilly coding book on OpenCV, \"Learning OpenCV\" has been the best selling computer vision or machine vision book for a year and a half no. OpenCV is used extensively in companies, research groups and by governmental bodies.  Some well known companies that use OpenCV are Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Intel, IBM, Sony, Honda, Toyota. Many startups such as Applied Minds, VideoSurf, and Zeitera make extensive use of OpenCV. OpenCV's deployed uses span the range from stitching streetview images together, detecting intrusions in surveillance video in Israel, monitoring mine equipment in China (more notoriously, OpenCV is a key part of China's \"Green Dam\" internet filtering software ), helping robots navigate and pick up objects at Willowgarage, detection swimming pool drowning events in Europe, running interactive art in Spain and New York, checking run ways for derbies in Turkey, inspecting labels on products in factories around the world on to rapid face detection in Japan.  OpenCV leans mostly towards real time vision applications and takes advantage of MMX and SSE instructions when available. A CUDA interface is being developed right now. There are over 500 algorithms and about 10 times as many functions that compose or support those algorithms. OpenCV is written natively in C++ and has a templated interface that works seamlessly with std containers. Its native data type is a general matrix class that reference counts and leverages LAPACK and (in April) EIGEN. OpenCV also has a full custom Python interface and, using SWIG, OpenCV has interfaces to Matlab and Octave. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products. To enable this, OpenCV has a BSD license to make it easy for businesses to use and modify the code.",

    "about": "ns-3 is a discrete-event network simulator, with a particular emphasis on network research and education. Users of ns-3 can construct simulations of computer networks using models of traffic generators, protocols such as TCP/IP, and devices and channels such as WiFi, and analyze or visualize the results. Simulation plays a vital role in the research and education process, because of the ability for simulations to obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet been implemented. A particular emphasis in ns-3 is the high degree of realism in the models (including frameworks for real application and kernel code) and integration of the tool with virtual machine environments and testbeds; we view that researchers need to move more effortlessly between simulation, testbeds, and live experiments, and ns-3 is designed to facilitate that.  ns-3 has been in development since 2005 and has been making quarterly releases since June 2008 (our last release was ns-3.7 in January 2010).  ns-3 is replacing the popular ns-2 tool which was developed in the 1997-2000 timeframe but became dated and unmaintained. The tool is coming into wide use; our web server logged over 10,000 successful downloads of our released software in January 2010, and we have a users mailing list of about 500 members now averaging 200-300 posts per month.  ns-3 is operated as an open source project with financial backing from an NSF grant and funding from the French government (and via help from Google Summer of Code). We use a GPLv2 licensing model and heavily use mailing lists and to a lesser extent an IRC channel. We have roughly 10 maintainers worldwide and roughly 50 people have contributed code or patches to date.",

The project was started by Sam Hart over ten years ago and currently maintains and develops three software programs. The programs take their name from Tux, the Linux mascot. Tux Paint, led by Bill Kendrick, is an award-winning and widely used artistic graphics program. Tux Paint is enjoyable for everyone from the youngest children capable of using computers up through adults. Tux Math (originally written by Bill Kendrick, now led by David Bruce and Tim Holy) is a video game-style math drill program. It covers basic math operations up through topics such as negative numbers, factoring, and order-of-operations exercises. Tux Typing (originally written by Sam Hart, now led by David Bruce) offers word typing practice in the setting of two video game-type activities, as well as phrase and sentence typing for older students. All three programs are SDL-based C apps, licensed under the GPL. They are developed natively on Linux and are included in all major desktop distributions, as well as non-Linux Free Software collections such as the FreeBSD Ports Collection and the MacPorts project for OS-X. Builds are also available for Microsoft Windows and BeOS. The aim is to avoid specific platform dependencies so the programs can be made available as widely as possible, including the computing environments that children are most likely to actually encounter in schools. Similarly, all three programs are extensively internationalized using the standard GNU gettext library.",

Because of its origination in Denmark the majority of TYPO3’s developer community is situated in Europe and especially in Germany, but TYPO3 is also enjoying a growing popularity in Asia, Africa, and the Americas recently.   There are about 300,000 installations world wide including high profile websites of large companies such as Lufthansa, Volkswagen, T-Online, DHL, 3M, General Electric, and Stanford University and many government sites to name a few.   Highlights of TYPO3’s feature set are its complete separation of content and design, a fine-grained permission system, a WYSIWYG rich text editor, an integrated versioning and workflow system, frontend / in-site editing, integrated search engine, dynamic navigation menu generation, dynamic graphics generation, standards compliant output and single source publishing, multi-language support, advanced caching system with reverse proxy support, and user registration. In addition an open API enables very versatile options for developing extensions and additional functionality.  TYPO3 as a CMS is currently undergoing a rewrite from scratch for its upcoming version five in parrallel to the further development on TYPO3 v4. As a basis for TYPO3 v5 a new framework (FLOW3) with features like AOP and DI is being built. Based on FLOW3 and also as another base component for TYPO3 v5 a JSR-283 compliant content repository is being built in a way that it can be reuseed by other open source projects.  The main goal of the TYPO3 Association is to support core development of the TYPO3 Open Source Content Management System on a steadier basis and improve the transparency and efficiency of various aspects of the TYPO3 project.",

The website was used to map incidents of violence and peace efforts throughout the country based on reports submitted via the web and mobile phone.

Moreover, these deep structural similarities can be exploited to transfer methods of analysis and understanding from one field to another.

Examples of components include convex hulls, convex decomposition, Delaunay triangulations, Voronoi diagrams, polygonal surface mesh data-structures, mesh generation, Boolean operations, envelope computations, intersection detection, surface reconstruction, and subdivision surfaces. CGAL is used in a variety of application domains such as CAD/CAM (computer aided design and modeling), GIS (geographic information systems), geophysics, image processing, molecular biology, robotics, motion planning, and graphics. CGAL is written in C++ and rigorously adheres to the generic-programming paradigm. CGAL became an Open Source project in 2003. Most of CGAL is under the QPL license, and some core parts are under the LGPL (v2.1). The semi-annual releases have currently about 10,000 downloads. CGAL is commercially supported by the spin-off company GeometryFactory.",

    "about": "Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), based in Switzerland, has been consistently ranked among the best European research institutions in computer science. The Programming Languages Laboratory (LAMP) is led by Professor Martin Odersky. Odersky, an ACM Fellow, is considered one of the world's top experts in programming languages design. He is the co-designer of the Java Generics proposal and is the one of the original authors of the current javac compiler. Aside from Prof. Odersky, LAMP comprises 7 graduate students and 5 post-doctoral researchers/programmers. We are best known for the development of the Scala programming language (http://www.scala-lang.org), which is generating ever-increasing interest from industry and research communities alike. Currently, Scala is extensively used in prominent companies, including Twitter, Xerox, Sony, LinkedIn, EDFT, Siemens, and Reaktor. Additionally, we have close ties with external Scala-related projects, such as the Eclipse Scala plugin (www.scala-ide.org), Lift (http://liftweb.net/), Akka (http://www.scala-lang.org/node/4791), Kestrel (http://www.scala-lang.org/node/1008), and ScalaTest (http://node/3869). Scala runs on the JVM and .NET, integrating near-seamlessly with libraries on those platforms. This signficantly reduces barriers to adoption and has been a key factor in Scala’s success. Worldwide, there are an estimated 100,000 skilled Scala programmers--a number that is continually increasing. Last year’s Scala Days conference (http://days2010.scala-lang.org/) garnered significant interest within the community--so much so that we reached capacity long before the registration deadline. We expect an even larger turnout for this year’s conference. Scala development is supported by quality development tools: Jenkins for build, issue tracking with Trac (soon to be Jira), version control with SVN and Git, and an extensive test-suite.",

    "about": "[IMAGE http://www.gnu.org/graphics/heckert_gnu.small.png] The GNU Project was launched in 1984 to develop a complete Unix-like operating system which is free software -- software which respects your freedom. Unix-like operating systems are built from a collection of applications, libraries, and developer tools -- plus a program to allocate resources and talk to the hardware, known as a kernel. The Hurd, GNU's kernel, is actively developed, but is still some way from being ready for daily use, so GNU is often used with a kernel called Linux. The combination of GNU and Linux is the GNU/Linux operating system, now used by millions and sometimes incorrectly called simply 'Linux'. Being a very large and complex project, and following the Unix philosophy, GNU is subdivided into packages, that is, independent programs with a specific goal. As a mentoring organization in Summer of Code 2011, GNU aims to act as an umbrella for its packages.",

The development of Jitsi started out at the University of Strasbourg, France (http://www.unistra.fr) but has grown to include contributors from all over the world. Many of them have actually joined after successfully participating in previous GSoC editions. Jitsi is based on the OSGi (http://osgi.org) architecture using the Felix implementation from Apache, which makes it very extensible and developer friendly. Just as last year, Jitsi is once again participating with a couple of closely related projects: Kamailio (http://kamailio.org), which was previously known as OpenSER is one of the most widely deployed open source (GPL) SIP proxies. It is widely known for its ability to handle thousands of calls per second and its many features. SEMS (http://iptel.org/sems) is a media and application server for SIP based VoIP services. Because of its simplicity and flexibility it is commonly used with SIP proxies such as Kamailio or SER as one of the build blocks of various complex VoIP systems. Together, Jitsi, Kamailio and SEMS represent an open alternative to proprietary communications systems such as Skype, or Live Messenger. Our communities often work together on various problems and our combined GSoC participation is an excellent way of moving forward with them.",

They record street names, village names and other features using notebooks, digital cameras, and voice-recorders. Back at the computer, contributors upload those GPS logs showing where they travelled, and trace-out the roads on OpenStreetMap's collaborative database. Using their notes, contributors add the street names, information such as the type of road or path, and the connections between roads. That data is then processed to produce detailed street-level maps, which can be published freely on sites such as Wikipedia, used to create handheld or in-car navigation devices, or printed and copied without restriction.",

We also do well with students whose coding projects have an academic bent. We like to mentor projects in the technology end of the open source space, including Linux kernel driver work and open hardware/software systems work with a solid code component. That said, a number of our projects have been at the applications level as well; one of our strengths is the ability to track down mentors for a wide variety of different kinds of activity.

JPF is a highly extensible Java Virtual Machine (JVM) written in Java itself, and is used to create a variety of verification tools ranging from concurrency software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has serious contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities world-wide. The JPF team for GSoC 2011 is led by the NASA Ames Research Center, but includes mentors from UIUC, NCSU, University of Texas, Brigham Young University and the universities of Stellenbosch SA, Tokyo JP and Prague CZ. JPF is designed to be extensible. There are well defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence we host a number of such extension projects on our own, public JPF server, together with a Wiki that is the one-stop for learning about, obtaining and contributing to JPF. As JPF has matured in its ability to perform verification on traditional Java programs, we in the process of extending JPF to verify software running on mobile devices. Given that Android is one of the largest open-source framework for mobile computing, we are extending JPF to specifically verify Android applications and the also the Android operating systems.",

It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer (Zenmap), a flexible data transfer, redirection, and debugging tool (Ncat), a utility for comparing scan results (Ndiff), and a packet generation and response analysis tool (Nping).",

JPF is a highly extensible Java Virtual Machine (JVM) written in Java itself, and is used to create a variety of verification tools ranging from concurrency software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has serious contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities world-wide. The JPF team for GSoC 2012 is led by the NASA Ames Research Center, but includes mentors from NCSU, University of Texas, Brigham Young University and the universities of Stellenbosch SA, Tokyo JP, and Prague CZ.JPF is designed to be extensible. There are well defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence we host a number of such extension projects on our own, public JPF server, together with a Wiki that is the one-stop for learning about, obtaining and contributing to JPF.JPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android. JPF is constantly being extended with support for verification of new types of properties for new types of application domains.",

    "about": "ns-3 is a discrete-event network simulator, distributed as free and open-source software, with an emphasis on networking research and education. Users of ns-3 can construct simulations of computer networks using models of traffic generators, protocols such as TCP/IP, and devices and channels such as WiFi, and analyze or visualize the results. Simulation plays a vital role in the research and education process because of the ability for simulations to obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet been implemented. A particular emphasis in ns-3 is the high degree of realism in the models (including frameworks for using real application and kernel code) and integration of the tool with virtual machine environments and testbeds. We believe that these are distinguishing technical characteristics of the tool. ns-3 has been in development since 2005 and has been making regular releases since June 2008 (our last release was ns-3.13 in December 2011). ns-3 is replacing the popular ns-2 tool which was developed in the 1997-2000 timeframe but became dated and unmaintained. The tool is in wide use; we provide statistics about the project on our web site (under the Overview/Statistics page), but in summary, we logged 86,000 downloads of our releases in calendar year 2011, we have a users group with 1500 members, a developers mailing list with 1200 members, 24 maintainers, and 93 people listed as authors of the code. ns-3 is operated as an open source project with financial backing from three NSF grants, funding from the French government, and help from the Google Summer of Code. We use a GPLv2 licensing model and heavily use mailing lists and to a lesser extent an IRC channel.",

    "about": "Our laboratory focuses on applying the tools of bioinformatics (the intersection of computer science, biology, and statistics) to biomedical discovery. We are part of the the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, one of the largest non-profit research organizations devoted to biomedical research. Our GSoC application and ideas focus on synergies between crowdsourcing and biological research. Our team develops new technologies and tools to enable large communities of scientists to collaboratively address biological challenges of massive scale. We operate at the exciting intersection between biological and computational research. Our flagship projects include: - The Gene Wiki, an initiative to create a continuously-updated, community-reviewed, and collaboratively-written review article for every human gene. The Gene Wiki receives over 50 million pageviews per year by both scientists and the general public. - BioGPS, a community-extensible gene annotation portal for aggregating and integrating gene-centric knowledge. This resource is more focused on active researchers, and it receives approximately two million pageviews per year. Through these efforts, we’ve already demonstrated that we can productively harness the efforts of thousands of scientists and community members. We’ve thus far focused on huge challenges in biological knowledge management. To complement the collaborative spirit of these projects, we have recently turned our own software development projects into open source projects.",

Started as a student project itself at the university five years ago, Gephi has quickly become the open source software leader in the visualization and analysis of large networks (+135,000 downloads of the previous release). It is an important contribution to the ecosystem of tools used by researchers and big data analysts to explore and extract value from the deluge of relational data, and disseminate a better ability for the people to think about a “connected” world.Gephi is a “Photoshop” for such data: designed to make data navigation and manipulation easy, it covers the entire process from data importing to aesthetics refinements and communication. Users interact with the visualization and manipulate structures, shapes and colors to reveal the properties of complex and messy data. The goal is to help data analysts to make hypotheses and intuitively discover patterns or errors in large data collections.Gephi is built with Java SE 6 on top of the NetBeans Platform, and uses a large number of Java libraries, including JOGL for its 3-D rendering engine. The strength of Gephi is its usability, performance, and modularity. Modules are loosely coupled, and extensible with plug-ins. Data-centered companies such as LinkedIn, Xerox, Elsevier, and many research laboratories have already used Gephi for visualizing their data.Gephi is supported by the Gephi Consortium, a non-profit organization created to ensure future developments of the technology.Introduction in video: http://gephi.org/2010/video-introducing-gephi-0-7/Gephi was officially presented at the 3rd Int'l AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media (ICWSM'09) conference (http://www.icwsm.org).Award: Oracle Duke's Choice 2010 winner http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/dukeschoicewinners-171159.html",

It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer (Zenmap), a flexible data transfer, redirection, and debugging tool (Ncat), a utility for comparing scan results (Ndiff), and a packet generation and response analysis tool (Nping).",

Our specialty is projects that clearly benefit the student, the open source community, and society in general, but have no obvious fit in the standard mentoring organizations. In particular, we tend to focus on small-scale or individual risky-but-promising open source \"seed\" projects that we think will grow into something great. We also do well with students whose coding projects have an academic bent. We often mentor projects in the technology end of the open source space, including hardware/software systems work with a solid code component. In fact, for 2013 we are placing a special emphasis on Enabling Open Hardware.",

The development team works either by reverse engineering game executables (usually with the permission of creators of the game), or by using the original source code of the games provided by the creators. The number of engines is constantly growing thanks to a very agile and diversified development team. The VM approach followed by ScummVM results in efficient code, which has been ported to numerous Operating Systems. Besides running on all mainstream desktop environments, namely Windows, Mac OS X and most Unix variants (Linux, *BSD, Solaris), ScummVM also runs on popular game consoles (Wii, Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Dingoo and more), smart phones and PDAs (Android, WinCE, iPhone or Symbian based), and even on many not-so-mainstream systems (like BeOS, AmigaOS or OS/2). ScummVM has a highly productive team of about 42 currently active developers (out of an all-time pool of over 110), working together on a codebase almost 1,700,000 lines of code. In addition ScummVM has many non-developer contributors, and a huge and highly active community.

JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has serious contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities world-wide. The JPF team for GSoC 2013 is led by the NASA Ames Research Center, but includes mentors from NCSU, University of Texas, University of Utah, Brigham Young University and the universities of Stellenbosch SA, Tokyo JP, and Prague CZ.JPF is designed to be extensible. There are well defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence we host a number of such extension projects on our own, public JPF server, together with a Wiki that is the one-stop for learning about, obtaining and contributing to JPF.JPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android. JPF is constantly being extended with support for verification of new types of properties for new types of application domains.",

    "about": "Tux4Kids is a volunteer project dedicated to creating fun and educational software for children. The project was started by Sam Hart over ten years ago and currently maintains and develops three software programs. The programs take their name from Tux, the Linux mascot. Tux Paint, led by Bill Kendrick, is an award-winning and widely used artistic graphics program. Tux Paint is enjoyable for everyone from the youngest children capable of using computers up through adults. Tux Math (originally written by Bill Kendrick, now led by David Bruce, Tim Holy and Aaditya Maheshwari) is a video game-style math drill program. It covers basic math operations up through topics such as negative numbers, factoring, and order-of-operations exercises. Tux Typing (originally written by Sam Hart, now led by David Bruce) offers word typing practice in the setting of two video game-type activities, as well as phrase and sentence typing for older students. All three programs are SDL-based C apps, licensed under the GPL. They are developed natively on Linux and are included in all major desktop distributions, as well as non-Linux Free Software collections such as the FreeBSD Ports Collection and the MacPorts project for OS-X. Builds are also available for Microsoft Windows and Haiku/BeOS. The aim is to avoid specific platform dependencies so the programs can be made available as widely as possible, including the computing environments that children are most likely to actually encounter in schools. Similarly, all three programs are extensively internationalized using the standard GNU gettext library. Starting this year, we are interested in expanding beyond the traditional desktop application model into web-based and mobile learning games. Potential approaches include javascript/html5 for cross-platform mobile development, and Java language programming for applets, installed applications, and (with some modification) Android devices.",
